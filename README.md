# Cross-Platform Pinner App 

The app has been tested on iOS 15.5. Currently Web is not supported. Android is supported but may not work on all devices.

## Getting Started

This app (name still not final) is a bookmark manager that works cross-platform, made possible by Flutter. The can either be used in local data mode or you may sign in to Pinboard.in, 'Social Bookmarking for Introverts', inheritor of the Delicious API, pioneering the pay-once business model of slow growth as an alternative to traditional 'growth at all costs' startup culture. Going strong for almost 15 years, the platform is reliable and essential to many long-time users' workflows.

My goal is to provide a modern fully-featured cross platform app to manage bookmarks for the user. Users are encouraged to use their Pinboard.in accounts to manage their long-running lists of bookmarks. Though no Pinboard account is required if a user prefers to use the app standalone, I will not be hosting your bookmarks in the cloud or competing with Pinboard in any way.

To run the app in debug mode:

- Clone the repo
- Install Flutter and add it to your Path.
- Run From the terminal: Run `flutter pub get`.
- Open mobile emulator or desired target device.
- Run `flutter run`.
